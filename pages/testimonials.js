          Working with Jo is undoubtedly satisfying. Not only due to the
          welcoming environment they create, but also down to their brain
          working like a well oiled set of gears that can piece apart and tackle
          any issue from a multitude of angles. It puts your own mind at ease
          pairing with someone whose cogs turn in a way that leaves little to no
          room for error.

          I’ve really enjoyed working with Jo, they are always considerate of
          everyone on the team. Their technical knowledge and ability to look
          for and understand useful resources online is really impressive. Jo is
          super kind and always goes above and beyond for the team as well as
          the cohort in general!

          I'm always super impressed with Jo. They are organised, calm, kind and
          very clear in communication. They are super quick at figuring out a
          solution to complex problems, and also v quick to finding
          tools/technologies to help you. I’m constantly impressed with their
          knowledge of tech. I found them to be a very natural leader in our
          teams!
